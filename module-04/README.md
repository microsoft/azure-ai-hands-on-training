# Module 4 - Advanced AML Concepts for Professional Data Scientists andÂ ML Engineers

## Hands-On exercises

### Exercise 1 - Simple training pipeline

* This example shows how to construct and execute a basic AML pipeline for model training
* Walk through [00-single-training-step/pipeline.ipynb](00-single-training-step/pipeline.ipynb)

### Exercise 2 - Multi-step pipeline

* This example shows how to construct and execute a two-step pipeline that runs data preparation and model training afterwards
* Walk through [00-single-training-step/pipeline.ipynb](00-single-training-step/pipeline.ipynb)
